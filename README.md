# RandomPiCalculator
This consists of a c program and a python3 code which will use the random point method to find the value of pi in double.
  
The longer you run it the better would be its value.
  
To compare the value use: <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/%7Ehuberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html">100,000 Digits of Pi</a>
